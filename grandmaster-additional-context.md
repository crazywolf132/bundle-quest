# BundleQuest Grandmaster Exercises - Detailed Guide

This guide provides additional context, resources, and research topics for each of the Grandmaster level exercises. Use this information to deepen your understanding and guide your implementation efforts.

## Exercise 1: Implementing a Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler

### Additional Context:
JIT compilation is a technique used by modern JavaScript engines to improve performance. It involves compiling frequently executed code paths to native machine code at runtime.

### Key Components to Implement:
1. Profiler: Tracks function calls and identifies hot code paths.
2. Intermediate Representation (IR) Generator: Converts JavaScript to an optimized intermediate form.
3. Native Code Generator: Translates IR to machine code.
4. Execution Manager: Switches between interpreted and compiled code execution.

### Topics to Research:
- Bytecode interpretation vs JIT compilation
- Tracing JIT vs Method JIT
- Optimization techniques: type specialization, inlining, loop unrolling
- Deoptimization and bailout mechanisms

### Helpful Resources:
- [A crash course in just-in-time (JIT) compilers](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-crash-course-in-just-in-time-jit-compilers/)
- [V8 JIT compiler overview](https://v8.dev/docs/turbofan)
- [Vyacheslav Egorov's blog on V8 internals](https://mrale.ph/)

### Implementation Tips:
- Start with a simple bytecode interpreter before adding JIT compilation.
- Use a library like [Lightening](https://www.gnu.org/software/lightning/) for native code generation.
- Implement basic optimizations first, then gradually add more complex ones.

## Exercise 2: Implementing a Garbage Collector

### Additional Context:
Garbage collection is crucial for automatic memory management in JavaScript. A mark-and-sweep collector is a fundamental GC algorithm that forms the basis for more advanced techniques.

### Key Components to Implement:
1. Object Allocation Tracker
2. Root Set Identifier
3. Mark Phase Implementation
4. Sweep Phase Implementation

### Topics to Research:
- Mark-and-sweep algorithm
- Generational garbage collection
- Incremental and concurrent garbage collection
- Write barriers and read barriers

### Helpful Resources:
- [A tour of V8: Garbage Collection](https://v8.dev/blog/trash-talk)
- [Memory Management MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management)
- [The Garbage Collection Handbook](http://gchandbook.org/)

### Implementation Tips:
- Start with a basic, stop-the-world mark-and-sweep collector.
- Use colored marking for objects (white, gray, black) to implement tri-color marking.
- Implement weak references and finalizers as an advanced feature.

## Exercise 3: Implementing a Time-Travel Debugger

### Additional Context:
Time-travel debugging allows developers to move backwards through a program's execution history, which is incredibly useful for understanding complex bugs.

### Key Components to Implement:
1. Execution State Recorder
2. Reverse Execution Engine
3. State Inspection API
4. Integration with Source Code

### Topics to Research:
- Reverse debugging techniques
- Execution logging and replay
- Efficient state storage and retrieval
- Deterministic replay of non-deterministic operations

### Helpful Resources:
- [Replay-Based Debugging](https://rr-project.org/)
- [Time Travel Debugging in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/time-travel-debugging-overview)
- [OctoML's Pragmatic Approach to Time Travel Debugging](https://octoml.ai/blog/a-pragmatic-approach-to-time-travel-debugging/)

### Implementation Tips:
- Start by logging every state change and function call.
- Implement checkpointing to reduce memory usage for long-running programs.
- Use source maps to correlate execution states with original source code positions.

## Exercise 4: Implementing a Zero-Downtime Hot Module Replacement System

### Additional Context:
Hot Module Replacement (HMR) allows updating modules in a running application without a full reload, significantly improving developer experience.

### Key Components to Implement:
1. Module Dependency Graph
2. Update Propagation System
3. State Preservation Mechanism
4. Runtime Code Swapping

### Topics to Research:
- Webpack's HMR implementation
- React Fast Refresh
- Module federation and dynamic loading
- State management during hot reloading

### Helpful Resources:
- [Webpack HMR Concepts](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/)
- [Exploring Hot Module Replacement Deeply](https://indepth.dev/posts/1497/exploring-how-hot-module-replacement-works-deeply)
- [React Fast Refresh Architecture](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-refresh/README.md)

### Implementation Tips:
- Start with a simple module replacement system, then add state preservation.
- Implement a dependency graph to track which modules need updating when a change occurs.
- Use proxies to swap out module implementations seamlessly.

## Exercise 5: Implementing a Custom JavaScript Engine

### Additional Context:
Building a JavaScript engine from scratch provides deep insights into language implementation and runtime behavior.

### Key Components to Implement:
1. Lexical Analyzer (Tokenizer)
2. Parser (AST Generator)
3. Bytecode Compiler
4. Virtual Machine for Bytecode Execution

### Topics to Research:
- Parsing techniques: recursive descent, operator-precedence parsing
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representations
- Bytecode design and instruction set architecture
- Stack-based vs register-based virtual machines

### Helpful Resources:
- [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom
- [The Super Tiny Compiler](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler)
- [V8 JavaScript Engine Design](https://v8.dev/docs)
- [SpiderMonkey Internals](https://spidermonkey.dev/)

### Implementation Tips:
- Start with a subset of JavaScript (variables, functions, basic control flow).
- Use existing tools like [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) or [Jison](https://zaa.ch/jison/) for parsing initially.
- Implement a stack-based VM first, then optimize to register-based if desired.
- Add features incrementally: start with basic arithmetic, then add functions, then objects, etc.

Remember, these exercises are extremely challenging and may take considerable time to complete. We encourage you to break down each task into smaller, manageable pieces and to focus on understanding the underlying concepts as much as producing a working implementation. The journey of learning and discovery is as valuable as the final result in these exercises.
